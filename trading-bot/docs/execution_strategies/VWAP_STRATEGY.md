# VWAP Execution Strategy

## Overview
The Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) execution strategy is designed to execute large orders by breaking them into smaller child orders over time, minimizing market impact and optimizing execution quality.

- ML-based impact prediction
- Adaptive order sizing based on market conditions

### Adaptive Order Sizing
- Dynamic adjustment of order sizes based on:
  - Current market liquidity
  - Volatility conditions
  - Historical volume profiles
  - Predicted market impact

### Smart Order Routing
- Optimal venue selection
- Dark pool integration
- Anti-gaming measures

### Performance Analytics
- Real-time execution monitoring
- Slippage tracking
- Benchmark comparisons
- Detailed execution reports

## Configuration

### VWAP Parameters

```python
class VWAPParameters:
    # Time interval between child orders (in seconds)
    interval_seconds: int = 300  # 5 minutes
    
    # Maximum number of child orders
    max_child_orders: int = 12  # 1 hour of 5-min intervals
    
    # Base percentage of historical volume to target (0-1)
    volume_participation: float = 0.1  # 10% of volume
    
    # Dynamic participation rate adjustment bounds
    min_participation_rate: float = 0.05  # 5% minimum
    max_participation_rate: float = 0.50  # 50% maximum
    
    # Maximum slippage allowed from VWAP (in basis points)
    max_slippage_bps: int = 5  # 0.05%
    
    # Order type configuration
    use_limit_orders: bool = True
    limit_order_tolerance_bps: int = 2  # 0.02%
    
    # Advanced features
    enable_price_improvement: bool = True
    enable_volatility_scaling: bool = True
    enable_anti_gaming: bool = True
    enable_dark_pool_routing: bool = False
    dark_pool_participation: float = 0.3  # 30% to dark pools
```

## Usage Example

```python
from core.execution.strategies.vwap import VWAPExecutionClient, VWAPParameters
from core.models.order import Order, OrderSide, OrderType
from core.models.execution import ExecutionParameters, ExecutionMode

# Initialize VWAP client
vwap_params = VWAPParameters(
    volume_participation=0.15,  # Target 15% of volume
    use_limit_orders=True,
    enable_volatility_scaling=True
)

client = VWAPExecutionClient(
    client_id="my_client",
    market_data=market_data_service,
    risk_manager=risk_manager,
    vwap_params=vwap_params
)

# Create parent order
order = Order(
    symbol='BTC/USDT',
    side=OrderSide.BUY,
    quantity=Decimal('10.0'),  # 10 BTC
    order_type=OrderType.MARKET
)

# Set execution parameters
exec_params = ExecutionParameters(
    mode=ExecutionMode.LIVE,
    max_slippage_bps=10,  # 0.1% max slippage
    max_position_pct=0.2,  # Max 20% of portfolio
    max_order_value=100000  # $100k max per order
)

# Execute strategy
result = await client.execute(order, exec_params)
```

## Market Impact Model

The strategy includes a sophisticated market impact model that predicts the price impact of orders based on:

- Order size relative to average volume
- Current market volatility
- Spread and liquidity conditions
- Time of day and day of week patterns
- Recent price action

### Model Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `quantity` | Order size in base currency |
| `participation_rate` | Order size as % of average volume |
| `volatility` | 30-day historical volatility |
| `spread_bps` | Current bid-ask spread in bps |
| `liquidity_score` | Normalized liquidity metric (0-1) |
| `time_of_day` | Hour and minute of execution |
| `day_of_week` | Day of week (0=Monday) |
| `trend_strength` | Strength of current price trend |
| `order_book_imbalance` | Current order book imbalance |

## Adaptive Order Sizing

The strategy dynamically adjusts order sizes based on:

1. **Market Conditions**
   - Higher volatility → Smaller orders
   - Wider spreads → More conservative sizing
   - Lower liquidity → Reduced participation

2. **Execution Performance**
   - Recent slippage → Adjust aggressiveness
   - Fill rates → Optimize order sizes
   - Impact costs → Refine participation rates

3. **Time-Based Adjustments**
   - Higher participation during liquid hours
   - Reduced size around market events
   - End-of-day position management

## Best Practices

### For Optimal Performance
1. **Monitor Execution Quality**
   - Regularly review execution reports
   - Track implementation shortfall
   - Compare against benchmarks

2. **Adjust Parameters**
   - Fine-tune participation rates
   - Optimize order intervals
   - Update risk parameters

3. **Risk Management**
   - Set appropriate position limits
   - Use stop-loss mechanisms
   - Monitor exposure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Slippage**
   - Reduce participation rate
   - Increase time horizon
   - Check market conditions

2. **Partial Fills**
   - Adjust order size limits
   - Review liquidity conditions
   - Consider time-in-force settings

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Check system resources
   - Review logging configuration
   - Optimize database queries

## Performance Metrics

Key metrics to monitor:

| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| VWAP Slippage | < 5 bps | Difference from market VWAP |
| Participation Rate | 5-20% | Order size as % of volume |
| Fill Rate | > 95% | Percentage of orders filled |
| Latency | < 100ms | Order submission time |
| Impact Cost | < 10 bps | Estimated market impact |

## Advanced Topics

### Customizing the Strategy

1. **Extending VWAPParameters**
   ```python
   class CustomVWAPParams(VWAPParameters):
       def __init__(self, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(**kwargs)
           self.custom_param = 1.0
   ```

2. **Custom Impact Model**
   ```python
   class CustomImpactModel:
       async def predict(self, features):
           # Custom impact prediction logic
           return predicted_impact_bps
   ```

3. **Event Hooks**
   ```python
   class CustomVWAPClient(VWAPExecutionClient):
       async def on_order_filled(self, order):
           # Custom fill handling
           await super().on_order_filled(order)
   ```
